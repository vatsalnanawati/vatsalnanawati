## 👋 Namaste, Apa Kabar, Bonjour, Hello!

I’m **Vatsal**, a data-driven problem solver passionate about transforming messy data into clear, actionable insights. Currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at **UC Davis**, I bring 3+ years of cross-functional experience at the intersection of **business strategy, data science**, and **engineering**.

Prior to grad school, I worked at **KPMG**, where I built automation pipelines and deployed fraud mitigation frameworks for telecom clients—directly reducing billing discrepancies by over **$300K**. Most recently at **Owens Corning**, I’ve been developing real-time dashboards, building **Generative AI** solutions, and using analytics to optimize operational strategy.

What drives me? Blending curiosity with precision. I thrive on uncovering insights that guide smarter decisions—whether it’s deploying scalable **SQL pipelines**, fine-tuning a **predictive model**, or working cross-functionally to deliver measurable business value.

Outside of work, I’m an adrenaline junkie and motorbike enthusiast—often found skydiving, trekking, or plotting my next **scuba diving** adventure.

Let’s connect! I’m always up for a conversation on **analytics, AI**, or the best hidden trekking trails 🌍
